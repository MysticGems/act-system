The current combat meters used in Second Life fall short of being a true role-play system, and frequently lack flexibility.  
They are usually tied to a particular genre of play; even the popular DCS2 system doesn't allow the kind of flexibility 
needed for superheroic and "roll your own genre" play.

The Mystic Gems Role-Play System will attempt to fill this role using a serverless set of attachments.  Design priorities 
(in no particular order) are:

* Implementation for a particular game independent of permanent Mystic Gems support (serverless)
* Handle any genre of play
* Does more than just combat
* Make use of existing, third-party items
* Open to expansion by players

This project is still in an early stage of system definition.
